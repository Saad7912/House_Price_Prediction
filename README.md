This model uses various machine learning libraries to predict housing prices. The primary model employed is the XGBoost Regressor (XGBRegressor), which has shown excellent performance. The following libraries are utilized:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For plotting and visualization.
seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and utilities, including data splitting, preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.
xgboost: For the XGBRegressor model, which is an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting.
Column Names and Their Meanings
The dataset contains the following columns, each representing different attributes of housing data:

CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town.
ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
TAX: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
B: 1000(Bkâˆ’0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
LSTAT: % lower status of the population.
price (MEDV): Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

By utilizing the XGBRegressor model with the specified libraries and column meanings, we can efficiently predict housing prices and evaluate model performance using various metrics. This approach ensures robust and reliable predictions, crucial for data-driven decision-making in real estate and housing market analysis.
